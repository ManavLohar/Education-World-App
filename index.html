            <p class="paraDesign">Education means more than acquiring knowledge. It empowers people to develop personally and become politically active. That’s not always in the interests of rulers, writes DW’s editor-in-chief Ute Schaeffer.
                Knowledge is power - this insight is at least four centuries old, formulated by philosopher Francis Bacon during the Enlightenment. His statement has lost nothing in terms of relevance and significance: Knowledge is power, and education is the fundamental precondition for political development, democracy and social justice.</p>

            <p class="paraDesign large-width-para">When I started thinking about why education is so important, I remembered my high school years when I used to spend almost five hours a month on math homework, wake up at 6:00 AM and get ready for my PSAL soccer game after school. I remembered my teachers, school subjects, the study and the fun! I never really hated school. But I have seen many of my peers who hated going to school; I have had some friends who did not like the idea of studying. Some needed to be up in summer school for recovery. I personally was always focused because I wanted to become a software engineer. I know it will be hard and very challenging. However I believe I can handle the challenge.</p>

            <p class="paraDesign">The first thing that strikes me about education is knowledge gain. Education gives us a knowledge of the world around us and changes it into something better. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life. “Education is not a name of any degree and certificate Education is a name of our attitude behaviours and other real thing of life”
                and I think any those buddies who’s gain these power so they gain world power.</p>
