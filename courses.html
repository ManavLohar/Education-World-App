                12th standard. Every year the questions hit lakhs of students in India and abroad. The confusion
                prevails among them concerning career prospects, job opportunities and yes, their passion, their
                preference. Counselors say that the lack of proper information about the courses available in India and
                their career prospects, is somewhere responsible. Science, Commerce and Arts are the options available
                in which students can find a suitable course to pursue after 12th.</p>
